# Hi there, I'm Cesar üëã

I'm a passionate software developer with a strong background in Rust, backend services, and systems programming. I enjoy diving deep into the inner workings of technologies and building robust and scalable solutions. Here's a bit about me and what I'm currently working on.

## üåü About Me

- üî≠ Currently working on a ledger database in Rust, still in the works but documenting my progress on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl0vOJuOj6F9NKWyQJFrzfWO4I_zxS2bj).
- üé• Check out my [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl0vOJuOj6F9NKWyQJFrzfWO4I_zxS2bj) for updates on the ledger database.
- ü¶Ä Experienced with Rust, having worked at major companies like Kraken and another Bitcoin-only exchange.
- üèóÔ∏è Contributed to improving architectures and implementing caching layers at Kraken.
- üåê Improved and made a resilient backend at another Bitcoin-only exchange, making it custodian agnostic while enhancing core product features.
- üí° Fan of 37Signals' work and philosophy and have been following them and DHH since the mid-2000s.

## üöÄ Projects

### CDK

I'm contributing actively to the [Cashu Development Kit](https://github.com/cashubtc/cdk/pulls/crodas) in Rust, which is part of the Cashu project. Cashu is a free and open-source Chaumian ecash protocol built for Bitcoin. A digital bearer token that is stored on a user's device is very similar to physical cash. The Cashu protocol allows you to build applications such as wallets or voucher systems. Transactions are instant and nearly free.

Some of my contributions are:

1. Add [real-time capabilities to the server](https://github.com/cashubtc/cdk/pull/394) and the [client wallet](https://github.com/cashubtc/cdk/pull/473)
2. Add [support for shared cache with Redis](https://github.com/cashubtc/cdk/pull/495) and set the foundation for adding more storage.


### Ledger Database
An open-source mini database written in Rust, designed to model financial transactions with ease. It includes a storage layer, an API interface, and a query language with its compiler and virtual machine. The transactions are append-only. Follow my [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl0vOJuOj6F9NKWyQJFrzfWO4I_zxS2bj) for the latest updates.

### [crodas/microredis](https://github.com/crodas/microredis)
A Redis clone implemented in Rust. Heads up, the code is old, but my Rust skills have improved significantly since then.

### C Extensions for PHP
I've built some C code for PHP, contributing to projects like:
- [MongoDB PHP Driver Legacy #13](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver-legacy/pull/13)
- [MongoDB PHP Driver Legacy #10](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver-legacy/pull/10)

### Compilers and Code Generation
I have always been interested in compilers and code generation. Check out [Haanga](https://github.com/crodas/Haanga), a template engine I developed.


## üíº Experience

### Another Bitcoin-Only Exchange
- Designed an internal framework to synchronize data with external parties (mainly qualified custodians).
- Integrated with more qualified custodians.
- Enhanced code and infrastructure to support a bank-grade ledger and other services.
- Improved the main website's performance.
- Enhanced the hiring process by designing a code challenge and interviewing candidates.

### Kraken
- Migrated legacy services into a modern implementation using Rust.
- Scaled services by implementing several layers of caching mechanisms.
- Introduced an internal in-memory cache with synchronized expiry to boost performance.
- Designed and maintained internal and external APIs.
- Developed API and backend services for the Kraken Consumer App, Kraken Earn/Staking product, and more.
- Integrated Credit Card, ACH, Google, and Apple Pay into the exchange.
- Improved scaling to handle increasing traffic and actively solved live incidents.
