# Hi there, I'm Cesar 👋

I'm a passionate software developer with a strong background in Rust, backend services, and systems programming. I enjoy diving deep into the inner workings of technologies and building robust and scalable solutions. Here's a bit about me and what I'm currently working on.

## 🌟 About Me

- 🔭 Currently working on a ledger database in Rust, still in the works but documenting my progress on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl0vOJuOj6F9NKWyQJFrzfWO4I_zxS2b).
- 🎥 Check out my [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl0vOJuOj6F9NKWyQJFrzfWO4I_zxS2b) for updates on the ledger database.
- 🦀 Experienced with Rust, having worked at major companies like Kraken and another Bitcoin-only exchange.
- 🏗️ Contributed to improving architectures and implementing caching layers at Kraken.
- 🌐 Improved and made resilient backend at another Bitcoin-only exchange, making it custodian agnostic while enhancing core product features.
- 💡 Fan of 37Signals' work and philosophy, and have been following them and DHH since the mid-2000s.

## 🚀 Projects

### Ledger Database
An open-source mini database written in Rust, designed to model financial transactions with ease. It includes a storage layer, an API interface, and a query language with its compiler and virtual machine. The transactions are append-only. Follow my [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl0vOJuOj6F9NKWyQJFrzfWO4I_zxS2b) for the latest updates.

### [crodes/microredis](https://github.com/crodas/microredis)
A Redis clone implemented in Rust. Heads up, the code is old, but my Rust skills have improved significantly since then.

### C Extensions for PHP
I've built some C code for PHP, contributing to projects like:
- [MongoDB PHP Driver Legacy #13](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver-legacy/pull/13)
- [MongoDB PHP Driver Legacy #10](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver-legacy/pull/10)

### Compilers and Code Generation
I have always been interested in compilers and code generation. Check out [Haanga](https://github.com/crodas/Haanga), a template engine I developed.


## 💼 Experience

### Another Bitcoin-Only Exchange
- Designed an internal framework to synchronize data with external parties (mainly qualified custodians).
- Integrated with more qualified custodians.
- Enhanced code and infrastructure to support a bank-grade ledger and other services.
- Improved the main website's performance.
- Enhanced the hiring process by designing a code challenge and interviewing candidates.

### Kraken
- Migrated legacy services into a modern implementation using Rust.
- Scaled services by implementing several layers of caching mechanisms.
- Introduced an internal in-memory cache with synchronized expiry to boost performance.
- Designed and maintained internal and external APIs.
- Developed API and backend services for the Kraken Consumer App, Kraken Earn/Staking product, and more.
- Integrated Credit Card, ACH, Google, and Apple Pay into the exchange.
- Improved scaling to handle increasing traffic and actively solved live incidents.
